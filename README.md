## üíÉ DanceOff
An app where every move counts! Elevate your dance game, challenge friends, and create your own signature moves in this dynamic and engaging app designed for the rhythm-driven generation.

### ‚ùìWhat
The ultimate dance challenge app that brings the thrill of dancing to the fingertips of children and other dance-minded individuals around the world. In this innovative and health-focused project, we've crafted a platform that goes beyond mere entertainment ‚Äì it's a journey towards improved well-being through the joy of movement.

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWhy
With childhood obesity being a growing problem, our aim is to help people get moving and get exercise. The app motivates people to do dance moves by providing a fun user experience and giving the users competition through leaderboards.

The app will remind people to move without making it feel like a chore. It is a fun way to express yourself and keep fit.

[This](https://youtu.be/cefSEHxjmeQ?si=cbJsqZwHUb1avs1H&t=53) could be you!

### üìñHow
The app provides a list of dance moves that you can do. By doing these moves, you will get points based on how well you did the dance moves. By earning points, you can be on the top of the leaderboard among everyone or a group of close friends!

### ‚öôÔ∏èTechnical details
The dance tracking is implemented in Swift using the Core Motion framework provided by apple. The core motion data is monitored in a [sliding window](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64111403), which is compared to the set of currently known dance moves. If the window matches a dance move well enough, the app will start to track the moves for a longer time. After the move is fully tracked, the accuracy is calculated using [dynamic time warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) to allow doing the dances in different speeds and [euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) to allow tracking the movement accuracy between the known movement data and the collected data. 

### ‚≠êFuture
Get the whole world dancing! The aim is to move this tracking to the watches, making every move really count. Standing in line? Dance. Waiting for a doctor's appointment? Dance. 

(Also should improve the app to use machine learning for move tracking and scoring)
